# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption method that involves shifting the letters of a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter that is a certain number of positions down the alphabet, determined by a shift value. To decrypt the message, the process is simply reversed, shifting the letters back by the same number of positions. While this cipher is simple and easy to use, its security is weak due to the limited number of possible shifts, making it vulnerable to easy decryption.

I have created a python code that encrypts and decrypts the a message using Caesar cipher algorithm where the message and the shift value is taken as an input from the user.
